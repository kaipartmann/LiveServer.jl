# Live Server for Julia

[![CI Actions Status](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl/actions)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tlienart/LiveServer.jl/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=mNry6r2aIn)](https://codecov.io/gh/tlienart/LiveServer.jl)

This is a simple and lightweight development web-server written in Julia,
based on [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl).
It has live-reload capability, i.e. when modifying a file, every browser (tab)
currently displaying the corresponding page is automatically refreshed.

LiveServer is inspired from Python's [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)
and Node's [`browsersync`](https://www.browsersync.io/).

## Installation

To install it in Julia ≥ 1.6, use the package manager with

```julia-repl
pkg> add LiveServer
```

### Legacy notes

For Julia `< 1.6`, you can use LiveServer's version 0.9.2:

```julia-repl
pkg> add LiveServer@0.9.2
```

For Julia `[1.0, 1.3)`, you can use LiveServer's version 0.7.4:

```julia-repl
pkg> add LiveServer@0.7.4
```

### Make it a shell command

LiveServer is a small package and fast to load with one main functionality (`serve`),
it can be convenient to make it a shell command: (I'm using the name `lss` here but
you could use something else):

```
alias lss='julia -e "import LiveServer as LS; LS.serve(launch_browser=true)"'
```

you can then use `lss` in any directory to show a directory listing in your browser,
and if the directory has an `index.html` then that will be rendered in your browser.

## Usage

The main function `LiveServer` exports is `serve` which starts listening to the current
folder and makes its content available to a browser.
The following code creates an example directory and serves it:

```julia-repl
julia> using LiveServer
julia> LiveServer.example() # creates an "example/" folder with some files
julia> cd("example")
julia> serve() # starts the local server & the file watching
✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

Open a Browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the content being rendered;
try modifying files (e.g. `index.html`) and watch the changes being rendered immediately in the browser.

In the REPL:
```julia-repl
julia> using LiveServer
julia> serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=8001, dir=".") # starts the remote server & the file watching
✓ LiveServer listening on http://0.0.0.0:8001...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

In the terminal:
```bash
julia -e 'using LiveServer; serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=8001, dir=".")'
```

Open a browser and go to https://localhost:8001/ to see the rendered content of index.html or,
if it doesn't exist, the content of the directory.
You can set the port to a custom number.
This is similar to the [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) in Python.

### Serve docs

`servedocs` is a convenience function that runs `Documenter` along with `LiveServer` to watch
your doc files for any changes and render them in your browser when modifications are detected.  

Assuming you are in `directory/to/YourPackage.jl`, that you have a `docs/` folder as
prescribed by [`Documenter.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and `LiveServer`
installed in your global environment, you can run:

```julia-repl
$ julia

pkg> activate docs

julia> using LiveServer

julia> servedocs()
[ Info: SetupBuildDirectory: setting up build directory.
[ Info: ExpandTemplates: expanding markdown templates.
...
└ Deploying: ✘
✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to see your docs being rendered;
try modifying files (e.g. `docs/index.md`) and watch the changes being rendered in the browser.

To run the server with one line of code, run:
```
$ julia --project=docs -ie 'using LiveServer; servedocs()'
```

### Serve docs with [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl)

When using the `servedocs` function together with documentation that contains `Literate` files, generating an $\infty$ loop is possible if `servedocs` is watching the generated `*.md` files for updates. Different folder structures require `servedocs` to contain specific keywords to prevent this from happening.

#### All files in `src`
```
docs
└── src
    ├── example.jl <-- Literate file
    ├── example.md <-- generated by Literate
    └── index.md
```
```julia
servedocs(literate="")
```

#### Literate files in `docs`
```
docs
├── literate
│   └── example.jl <-- Literate file
└── src
    ├── example.md <-- generated by Literate
    └── index.md
```
```julia
servedocs(literate=joinpath("docs","literate"))
```

## DEV/Path testing

See also issue #135 and related PRs.

* `servedocs()`, navigate to literate, images should show
* `serve()` navigate manually to `docs/build/` should show, remove trailing slash in URL `docs/build` should redirect to `docs/build/`
* `serve(dir=...)` should work + when navigating to assets etc
